# Customer-Behavior-and-Loan-Performance-Analytics

Project Objectives:

**1. Loan Performance Classification & Prediction**

Categorize customers into:

Performing loans

Non-performing loans

Defaulters

Use historical loan and payment behavior to predict which category new or current customers may fall into (machine learning model).

**2. Customer Acquisition & Retention Analysis**

Track how the customer base grows or shrinks over time.

Identify patterns leading to customer churn (loss) or loyalty.

Understand which acquisition channels or segments bring high-value customers.

**3. Transaction Activity Trends**

Analyze transaction volume/frequency over time.

Detect increases or decreases and identify timelines or patterns (seasonal changes, promo impacts, etc.).
